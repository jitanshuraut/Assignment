# Breadth First Search or BFS for a Graph
The breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is used to search a tree or graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria. It starts at the treeâ€™s root or graph and searches/visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Breadth-first search can be used to solve many problems in graph theory.

## Algorithm of breadth-first search
Step 1: Consider the graph you want to navigate.

Step 2: Select any vertex in your graph, Say v1, from which you want to traverse the graph.

Step 3:Examine any two data structure for traversing the graph.

             Visited array(size of the graph)

             Queue data structure

Step 4:Starting from the vertex, you will add to the visited array, and afterward, you will v1â€™s adjacent vertices to the queue data structure.

Step 5:Now,using the FIFO concept, you must remove the element from the queue , put it into the visited array, and then return to the queue to add the adjacent vertices of the removed element.

Step 6:Repeat step 5 until the queue is not empty and no vertex is left to be visited.

## Pseudocode
```
Breadth_First_Search( Graph, X ) // Here, Graph is the graph that we already have and X is the source node

Let Q be the queue
Q.enqueue( X ) // Inserting source node X into the queue
Mark X node as visited.

While ( Q is not empty )
Y = Q.dequeue( ) // Removing the front node from the queue

Process all the neighbors of Y, For all the neighbors Z of Y
If Z is not visited, Q. enqueue( Z ) // Stores Z in Q
Mark Z as visited
```

	g->V = V;

	for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {

			g->adj[i][j] = false;

{
	g->adj[v][w] = true; // Add w to vâ€™s list.
}

// prints BFS traversal from a given source s
void Graph_BFS(Graph* g, int s)
{
	// Mark all the vertices as not visited
	bool visited[MAX_VERTICES];
	for (int i = 0; i < g->V; i++) {
		visited[i] = false;
	}

	// Create a queue for BFS
	int queue[MAX_VERTICES];
	int front = 0, rear = 0;

	// Mark the current node as visited and enqueue it
	visited[s] = true;
	queue[rear++] = s;

	while (front != rear) {
		// Dequeue a vertex from queue and print it
		s = queue[front++];
		printf("%d ", s);

		// Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued
		// vertex s. If a adjacent has not been visited,
		// then mark it visited and enqueue it
		for (int adjacent = 0; adjacent < g->V;

	printf("Following is Breadth First Traversal "
		"(starting from vertex 2) \n");
	Graph_BFS(g, 2);

	Graph_destroy(g);

	return 0;
}

```
## Complexity of BFS algorithm
Time complexity of BFS depends upon the data structure used to represent the graph. The time complexity of BFS algorithm is O(V+E), since in the worst case, BFS algorithm explores every node and edge. In a graph, the number of vertices is O(V), whereas the number of edges is O(E).

The space complexity of BFS can be expressed as O(V), where V is the number of vertices.

## Advantages of Breadth First Search
ðŸŒŸ BFS will never get trapped exploring the useful path forever.
ðŸŒŸ If there is a solution, BFS definitely find it out.
ðŸŒŸ If there is more than one solution then BFS can find the minimal one that requires less number 
    of steps. If there is a solution then BFS is guaranteed to find it.
ðŸŒŸ Low storage requirement: linear with depth.
ðŸŒŸ Easily programmed.

##  Disadvantages of Breadth First Search:
The main drawback of BFS is its memory requirement. Since each level of the tree must be saved in order to generate the next level and the amount of memory is proportional to the number of nodes stored the space complexity of BFS is O(bd ), where b is the branching factor(the number of children at each node, the outdegree) and d is the depth. As a result, BFS is severely space-bound in practice so will exhaust the memory available on typical computers in a matter of minutes.

## Enhancements to BFS
â€¢ If BFS(i) sets visited[j] == 1, we know that i and j are connected
â€¢ How do we identify a path from i to j
â€¢ When we mark visited[k] = 1, remember the neighbour from which we marked it
â—¦ If exploring edge (j,k) visits k, set parent[k] = j

â€¢ BFS can record how long the path is to each vertex
â€¢ Instead of binary array visited[], keep integer array level []
â€¢ level[j] = -1 initially
â€¢ level[j] = p means j is reached in p steps from i


# Depth First Search or DFS for a Graph
Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

So the basic idea is to start from the root or any arbitrary node and mark the node and move to the adjacent unmarked node and continue this loop until there is no unmarked adjacent node. Then backtrack and check for other unmarked nodes and traverse them. Finally, print the nodes in the path.

## Follow the below steps to solve the problem:

ðŸŒŸ Create a recursive function that takes the index of the node and a visited array.
ðŸŒŸ Mark the current node as visited and print the node.
ðŸŒŸ Traverse all the adjacent and unmarked nodes and call the recursive function with the index of 
   the adjacent node.

```
## Complexity of Depth-first search algorithm
The time complexity of the DFS algorithm is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

The space complexity of the DFS algorithm is O(V)

## Advantages of Depth First Search:
Memory requirement is only linear with respect to the search graph. This is in contrast with breadth-first search which requires more space. The reason is that the algorithm only needs to store a stack of nodes on the path from the root to the current node.

The time complexity of a depth-first Search to depth d and branching factor b (the number of children at each node, the outdegree) is O(bd) since it generates the same set of nodes as breadth-first search, but simply in a different order. Thus practically depth-first search is time-limited rather than space-limited.

If depth-first search finds solution without exploring much in a path then the time and space it takes will be very less.

DFS requires less memory since only the nodes on the current path are stored. By chance DFS may find a solution without examining much of the search space at all.

## Disadvantages of Depth First Search:
The disadvantage of Depth-First Search is that there is a possibility that it may down the left-most path forever. Even a finite graph can generate an infinite tre One solution to this problem is to impose a cutoff depth on the search. Although ideal cutoff is the solution depth d and this value is rarely known in advance of actually solving the problem. If the chosen cutoff depth is less than d, the algorithm will fail to find a solution, whereas if the cutoff depth is greater than d, a large price is paid in execution time, and the first solution found may not be an optimal one.

Depth-First Search is not guaranteed to find the solution.

And there is no guarantee to find a minimal solution, if more than one solution

## DAG
In computer science and mathematics, DAG stands for "Directed Acyclic Graph". 

A DAG is a directed graph that has no cycles, which means that there is no way to start at any node and follow a sequence of directed edges that will eventually loop back to that node. Instead, the edges in a DAG go in a single direction, forming a tree-like structure. Each edge in a DAG has a direction, indicating that one node is the parent or predecessor, and the other node is the child or successor.

DAGs are commonly used in computer science to represent dependencies between tasks or data. For example, in a software build system, a DAG can be used to represent the dependencies between source code files, so that the build system can determine the correct order in which to compile them. DAGs are also used in data processing pipelines, where each node represents a step in the processing, and the edges indicate the data flow between the steps.

## Topological Ordering
Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Note: Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

## Algorithm for Topological Sorting:
Approach:

Create a stack to store the nodes.
Initialize visited array of size N to keep the record of visited nodes.
Run a loop from 0 till N
if the node is not marked True in visited array
Call the recursive function for topological sort and perform the following steps.
Mark the current node as True in the visited array.
Run a loop on all the nodes which has a directed edge to the current node
if the node is not marked True in the visited array:
Recursively call the topological sort function on the node
Push the current node in the stack.
Print all the elements in the stack.

# Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph
## DFS
To find cycle in a directed graph we can use the Depth First Traversal (DFS) technique. It is based on the idea that there is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge [i.e., a node points to one of its ancestors] present in the graph.

To detect a back edge, we need to keep track of the nodes visited till now and the nodes that are in the current recursion stack [i.e., the current path that we are visiting]. If during recursion, we reach a node that is already in the recursion stack, there is a cycle present in the graph.

```
// A C++ Program to detect cycle in a graph
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Graph {
	// No. of vertices
	int V;

	// Pointer to an array containing adjacency lists
	list<int>* adj;

	// Used by isCyclic()
	bool isCyclicUtil(int v, bool visited[], bool* rs);

public:
	Graph(int V);
	void addEdge(int v, int w);
	bool isCyclic();
};

Graph::Graph(int V)
{
	this->V = V;
	adj = new list<int>[V];
}

void Graph::addEdge(int v, int w)
{
	// Add w to vâ€™s list.
	adj[v].push_back(w);
}

// DFS function to find if a cycle exists
bool Graph::isCyclicUtil(int v, bool visited[],
						bool* recStack)
{
	if (visited[v] == false) {
		// Mark the current node as visited
		// and part of recursion stack
		visited[v] = true;
		recStack[v] = true;

		// Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this
		// vertex
		list<int>::iterator i;
		for (i = adj[v].begin(); i != adj[v].end(); ++i) {
			if (!visited[*i]
				&& isCyclicUtil(*i, visited, recStack))
				return true;
			else if (recStack[*i])
				return true;
		}
	}

	// Remove the vertex from recursion stack
	recStack[v] = false;
	return false;
}

// Returns true if the graph contains a cycle, else false
bool Graph::isCyclic()
{
	// Mark all the vertices as not visited
	// and not part of recursion stack
	bool* visited = new bool[V];
	bool* recStack = new bool[V];
	for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
		visited[i] = false;
		recStack[i] = false;
	}

	// Call the recursive helper function
	// to detect cycle in different DFS trees
	for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
		if (!visited[i]
			&& isCyclicUtil(i, visited, recStack))
			return true;

	return false;
}

	if (g.isCyclic())
		cout << "Graph contains cycle";
	else
		cout << "Graph doesn't contain cycle";
	return 0;
}
```
## BFS
The idea is to simply use Kahnâ€™s algorithm for Topological Sorting

Steps involved in detecting cycle in a directed graph using BFS.
Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the graph and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.
Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)
Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then. 

```
// A C++ program to check if there is a cycle in
// directed graph using BFS.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

	int V; // No. of vertices'

	// Pointer to an array containing adjacency list

	// function to add an edge to graph
	void addEdge(int u, int v);

	// Returns true if there is a cycle in the graph
	// else false.
	bool isCycle();
};

Graph::Graph(int V)
{
	this->V = V;
	adj = new list<int>[V];
}

void Graph::addEdge(int u, int v)
{
	adj[u].push_back(v);
}

// This function returns true if there is a cycle
// in directed graph, else returns false.
bool Graph::isCycle()
{
	// Create a vector to store indegrees of all
	// vertices. Initialize all indegrees as 0.
	vector<int> in_degree(V, 0);

	// Traverse adjacency lists to fill indegrees of
	// vertices. This step takes O(V+E) time

	// Initialize count of visited vertices
	// 1 For src Node
	int cnt = 1;

	// Create a vector to store result (A topological
	// ordering of the vertices)
	vector<int> top_order;

	// One by one dequeue vertices from queue and enqueue
	// adjacents if indegree of adjacent becomes 0
	while (!q.empty()) {

			// If in-degree becomes zero, add it to queue
			if (--in_degree[*itr] == 0)
			{
			q.push(*itr);
			//while we are pushing elements to the queue we will incrementing the cnt
			cnt++;
			}

		
	}

	// Check if there was a cycle

# Detect cycle in an undirected graph
Use DFS from every unvisited node. Depth First Traversal can be used to detect a cycle in a Graph. There is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge present in the graph. A back edge is an edge that is indirectly joining a node to itself (self-loop) or one of its ancestors in the tree produced by DFS. 

To find the back edge to any of its ancestors keep a visited array and if there is a back edge to any visited node then there is a loop and return true.

## BFS
In this article, the BFS based solution is discussed. We do a BFS traversal of the given graph. For every visited vertex â€˜vâ€™, if there is an adjacent â€˜uâ€™ such that u is already visited and u is not a parent of v, then there is a cycle in the graph. If we donâ€™t find such an adjacent for any vertex, we say that there is no cycle.

// in an undirected graph

# How to find Shortest Paths from Source to all Vertices using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is very similar to Primâ€™s algorithm for minimum spanning tree. 

Like Primâ€™s MST, generate a SPT (shortest path tree) with a given source as a root. Maintain two sets, one set contains vertices included in the shortest-path tree, other set includes vertices not yet included in the shortest-path tree. At every step of the algorithm, find a vertex that is in the other set (set not yet included) and has a minimum distance from the source.


To understand the Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm lets take a graph and find the shortest path from source to all nodes.
Consider below graph and src = 0



Step 1:

The set sptSet is initially empty and distances assigned to vertices are {0, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF} where INF indicates infinite. 
Now pick the vertex with a minimum distance value. The vertex 0 is picked, include it in sptSet. So sptSet becomes {0}. After including 0 to sptSet, update distance values of its adjacent vertices. 
Adjacent vertices of 0 are 1 and 7. The distance values of 1 and 7 are updated as 4 and 8. 
The following subgraph shows vertices and their distance values, only the vertices with finite distance values are shown. The vertices included in SPT are shown in green colour.




Step 2:

Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). The vertex 1 is picked and added to sptSet. 
So sptSet now becomes {0, 1}. Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 1. 
The distance value of vertex 2 becomes 12.


Step 3: 

Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). Vertex 7 is picked. So sptSet now becomes {0, 1, 7}. 
Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 7. The distance value of vertex 6 and 8 becomes finite (15 and 9 respectively). 


Step 4:

Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). Vertex 6 is picked. So sptSet now becomes {0, 1, 7, 6}. 
Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 6. The distance value of vertex 5 and 8 are updated.
 


We repeat the above steps until sptSet includes all vertices of the given graph. Finally, we get the following Shortest Path Tree (SPT).

## Complexity

Still O(n2)
```
â—¦ Different types of trees (heaps, red-black trees) allow both of the following in O(log n) time
â—¦ Find and delete minimum
â—¦ Insert or update a value
â—¦ With such a tree
â—¦ Finding minimum visit time vertex takes O(log n)
â—¦ With adjacency list, updating visit times takes O(log n) each, total O(m) edges
â—¦ Overall O(n log n + m log n) = O((n+m) log n)
